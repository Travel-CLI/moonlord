System fonts should be simple. They should be well readable and clear. If one of the fonts makes the user think, then this is not the best font for the system.

**Two main system fonts:**

<ul style="list-style-type:lower-greek;">
  <li>Ubuntu</li>
  <li>Inter</li>
</ul>

You can talk about coding fonts for a long time, but you need to remember one thing: coding fonts shouldn't be misleading and at the same time should be **very** readable. These are the two main rules and very few fonts that I have used meet them. The same Cartograph CF is not suitable for code at all, because its italics are misleading (God give me the strength to understand what is happening in the comments and keywords), although at first I thought it would be the best font that I used, so my favorite coding fonts are:

* Cascadia Code
* JetBrainsMono Nerd Font
